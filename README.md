## Overview
This algorithm focuses on the kinematic study of galaxies using the calcium triplet region to calculate accurate velocity dispersions ($\sigma$). 

## Features
- Velocity dispersion calculation for galactic nuclei.
- Spectral region analysis (8400–8700 Å).
- Analysis based on the ΛCDM model.
