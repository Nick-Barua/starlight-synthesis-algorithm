This repository contains the algorithmic implementation of the stellar spectral synthesis method described in the paper: 
**"Formation and Evolution of Galaxies: Starlight Synthesis Algorithm"** (Barua, 2022).

## Research Context
The algorithm facilitates the kinematic study of galaxies by analyzing the absorption lines of the **calcium triplet**. This spectral region is utilized to calculate precise velocity dispersions ($\sigma$), which serve as a proxy for understanding the mass of central black holes ($M_{\bullet}$) and the overall evolution of galactic structures under the $\Lambda$CDM model.

## Key Features
- **Spectral Synthesis:** Processing of stellar populations to model galactic light.
- **Kinematic Analysis:** Toolsets for measuring velocity dispersion in galactic and active nuclei.
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Built-in modules for error analysis in spectral fitting.
